# Google Billing FAQ
## Billing Quota
Increase your throughput on getting billing requests approved in down to 3 min by selecting "paid services" at all times.

You will run into the 5 project/billing account associations quota fairly early - you have 2 options.  Create a 2nd billing account to get 5 more - this may get flagged and cause a < 24 turnaround but may go through within the hour.  The other option is to prepay at least $50 to your account https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manual-payment?hl=en this will assist in verifying the account when you ask for a quota increase
